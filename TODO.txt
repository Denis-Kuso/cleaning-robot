# test for invalid input to instances of Room, position, or where input is given?
    # Which functions receive input?
        # Initialisation of Position
        # POS.getNewPos - raise error for angle and speed
        # Initialisation of Room - assert ints
        # Room.cleanTileAtPosition - pos object
        # Room.isTileCleaned - ints- no check
        # Room.isPositionInRoom - receive pos object
